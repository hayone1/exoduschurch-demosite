      Praise God!!!!

      It’s a simple testimony, I just want to thank God for the gift of my salvation.
      It’s been about 5 years now and I’m eternal grateful for the life I have received.
      My life literally changed the moment I got saved. 

      I’m just here to give God thanks!!!!!

      I want to thank God for protection, this morning I woke up full of Joy and gladness
      and was just singing songs of praise to God and on my way to church, the bus driver
      was about to start an argument about the bus stop to come down at and whatnot and we
      decided to come down. As we were coming down, I was going to come out head first and the
      door of the bus almost jammed my head in, but I thank God for preserving me. 

      I also want to thank God for my family and for my sister especially, I thank God for
      strengthening her and for adding to her family on Easter Sunday which was last week.
      Though there was a lot of unnecessary running up and down and scares inspired by the
      doctors even after the delivery, my sister called me crying and I just refused to accept
      whatever it is I was hearing, I comforted her and prayed with her and I want to thank God
      that she, her baby and her husband are all doing well. 

      Thank you Jesus!

      Praise God! 
      1. Last week as I was going to work, I got into a bus. I'd had a premonition that
      something wasn't right but I didn't get down because I felt weird getting down.
      On our way, while on third mainland bridge, the bus started having issues.
      It was constantly slowing down until it finally stopped a few metres before we got
      on the island.  The driver said petrol had finished. So we started walking.
      While I was walking, a car stopped on the way. Initially I didn't see it.
      But the man kept waving and I ran towards him. He picked me and took me to the nearest
      bus stop to my office. 

      Secondly I want to thank God for adding another year to my life, I'm taking him for
      providing concerning my photoshoot. I'd abandoned the idea of doing a photoshoot
      because there weren't funds. But somehow God provided and the pictures were beautiful. 

      Thirdly, I want to thank God because I'm done with training school. I'm grateful for
      the highs and lows and I want to thank God that I'm done with this phase and moving
      to the next phase.

      I want to thank God for my nephew.
      Yesterday at home he stretched and dislocated his shoulder.

      It was really painful and we were trying to re-align his shoulder but he wouldn’t
      let us because of how much painful it was.

      We eventually had to take him to the hospital.
      And he was shouting because of the pain.

      They checked his Xray and said it was a dislocation.
      They had to give him pain killers and at some point in the whole process,
      they had to sedate him.

      The consultant that was meant to attend to him eventually came really late.

      Before that he had started recalling some of the things we say during family
      devotion and asked me to play a message for him which I did.

      Then I told him to stop shouting and start confessing that the Holy Ghost would heal his shoulder.
      At some point he said that his shoulder felt different and it was more painful than before.

      When the consultant eventually came to relocate his shoulder, all he did was to give him
      a shoulder strap because his shoulder had already relocated itself.

      I was to give God glory for that supernatural healing that occurred even in the hospital.

      God that he was able to get home safely and the story was not worse than it was.
